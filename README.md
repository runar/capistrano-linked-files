# capistrano-linked-files

This gem provides Capistrano 3.1 reciepes to upload your linked files and directories. It's quite useful for files such as `config/database.yml` and `config/secrets.yml`, which are usually ignored (at least they should be) from version control systems.

Linked files and directories are placed in the `shared` directory on your remote servers and kept between deployments. After a new deployment, a symlink is created from the `shared` directory to the `current`Â directory.

Inspiration was found in damselem's [capistrano-shared-files](https://github.com/damselem/capistrano-shared-file), but capistrano-linked-files uses the "built in" Capistrano configuration variables `linked_files` and `linked_dirs` instead of custom ones. This way it's not necessary to specify your linked files twice.

## Installation

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'capistrano-linked-files'
```

Or install it to your system:

```
$ gem install capistrano-linked-files
```

## Usage

Add the gem to your `Capfile`:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/linked_files'
```

In `deploy.rb`, list the files and directories you'd like to keep between deployments:

```ruby
set :linked_files, %w(config/database.yml config/secrets.yml)
set :linked_dirs, %w(bin log tmp)
```

Ensure that the server you would like to upload files to is a part of the "web" role:
```ruby
server "10.10.10.10", user: 'deploy', role: %w{web}
```


Then run the task:

```
$ bundle exec cap <STAGE> linked_files:upload
```

If you only want to upload files or dirs, then run the tasks accordingly:

```
$ bundle exec cap <STAGE> linked_files:upload_files
$ bundle exec cap <STAGE> linked_files:upload_dirs
```

To automatically upload linked files and directories after a new deployment, add the following to your `deploy.rb`:

```ruby
# Uploading both linked_files and dirs
before :finishing, 'linked_files:upload'

# Uploading only linked_files
before :finishing, 'linked_files:upload_files'

# Uploading only dirs
before :finishing, 'linked_files:upload_dirs'
```
